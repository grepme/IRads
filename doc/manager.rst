This part of the module allows you to edit a person's details. Any fields with input will
be changed and any fields left blank will be left unchanged. This page also contains
a shortcut link to create a username for this person that takes you to the user creation
part of this module with the person preselected.


Add username
------------

This part of the module allows you to add a username to the system. Each person can have
multiple usernames. Each username in the system must be unique and the system will enforce
this. The access class chosen will restrict which modules the user has access to. A person
to whom this username will be assigned must be selected.
